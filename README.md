# stringine

A simple cross-language string manipulation utility

### Stringine left in the past.
Stringine development stopped in July 2020, and the repository is officially archived as of September 2021. The library works as normal, but it remains available in only 3 languages and has relatively small capabilities.

### What's Stringine?

We're aiming to build a string library available for as many languages as possible, with as similar functionality as possible for all platforms.

Stringine's functionality ranges from light functions (such as string capitalization and reversing) to more advanced functions (such as translating strings with character maps).
The reason why we have lighter features that a developer could implement themselves is being all-in-one: a developer only has to use Stringine and no other modules or implementations to achieve even the simplest functionality in their application!

A developer can also easily move the exact same line of code to another language and achieve the same result: that's what Stringine is all about.
